## Overview
### What is this app for?
 
This is a website for a small maintenance services company to market their services and detail all the vital info that potential customers require.
### What does it do?
 
This website allows customers to look at the services offered, read testimonials, look at past work. Customers can fill in the contact form for more information or a call back.
