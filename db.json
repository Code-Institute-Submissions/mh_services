        "body": "Ahead of this year\u2019s Gas Safety Week (September 18-24), Gas Safe Register and the Fire and Rescue Service is issuing a safety alert to raise awareness about the number of homes that do not have a carbon monoxide (CO) alarm to help defend themselves against CO poisoning, which can be fatal.\r\n\r\nNearly half (46%) of the nation\u2019s homes currently don\u2019t have a CO alarm, which could leave more than 12 million households across the UK at risk from CO poisoning.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to staying safe at home, three-quarters of people agree that they worry about safety, and spend time ensuring that their home is as safe as it can be, but British families are more likely to fit a smoke alarm (83%), double glazing (76%) or window locks (70%), than have a CO alarm (54%). CO poisoning is known as the \u2018silent killer\u2019 as you cannot see, taste, or smell it. A CO alarm can alert you to the presence of CO, which you may not be aware of.\r\n\r\nJonathan Samuel, chief executive, said: \u201cWe are encouraging families to ask a Gas Safe registered engineer to check that their gas appliances are safe and sound as a first line of defence from potential CO poisoning. Worryingly, nearly half (46%) of the people we asked didn\u2019t know the signs of dangerous gas appliances \u2013 a key cause of CO poisoning. The signs that your gas appliance isn\u2019t working safely are: a lazy yellow flame instead of a crisp blue flame, soot or staining on or around the appliance, or excess condensation in the room.\u201d\r\n\r\nGary Oakford, Carbon Monoxide Lead for Prevention Co-ordination Committee, The National Fire Chiefs Council, said: \u201cThe National Fire Chiefs Council supports Gas Safety Week 2017 and its aim to raise awareness of gas safety. We have seen the immense value of improving public safety by raising people\u2019s awareness of fire safety and having working smoke alarms in their homes.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is for this reason that we welcome the work by Gas Safe Register to ensure that the same approach is adopted for those with gas appliances in their homes by having working CO detectors and getting an annual safety check by a Gas Safe registered engineer.\u201d",

        "title": "When do you need an Electrician?",
        "body": "If you\u2019re a confident DIY-er, you may want to try your hand at a few electrical jobs around the house. However, electrical work is not only more complicated than many other household jobs, but some of the work must be carried out by a fully qualified electrician by law. At MG London we\u2019re often asked what kind of electrical repairs ordinary members of the public are allowed to do, and when you need to call in a professional. So we\u2019ve put together a list for you, so you know when to do it yourself, and when to call us.\r\n\r\nPart P of the Building Regulations\r\n\r\nSince 2005 the law on who can carry out electrical repairs in the home has changed. These laws, known as the Building Regulations, were updated in 2012 to include clarification on what is termed \u2018Part P\u2019. This states that it\u2019s the householder or landlord\u2019s responsibility to ensure that any electrical repairs are completely safe and don\u2019t pose a danger to anyone in the property. These are not guidelines \u2013 they\u2019re a legal requirement and are strictly enforced.\r\n\r\nWhen Part P was brought into effect, a list of jobs was drawn up that should be tackled only by a qualified and registered electrician. These \u2018notifiable\u2019 jobs are those that may be more challenging for someone with little or no formal training, and need to be \u2018signed off\u2019 by an electrician approved by the local building control body. So if you have to do any of the following jobs, you\u2019ll need to employ a fully qualified and registered electrician:\r\n\r\nRe-wire sockets or lights that are faulty and causing the fuse to trip\r\nReplace an old or damaged fuse board\r\nInstall outdoor or garden lights that run off mains electricity\r\nInstall additional sockets or a light switch as a spur from a ring main\r\nInstall communal hallway smoke alarms or emergency lighting\r\nInstall home entry systems\r\nEICR\r\nRun new circuits\r\nInstall electric radiators (where there weren\u2019t any before)\r\nInstall electric towel radiators if there isn\u2019t any existing electrical feed and A new a electrical circuit is required\r\nRepairs you can do yourself\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some jobs that you can do yourself without calling in a qualified electrician as long as you are competent with DIY/Handyman works around the house. These do not fall under \u2018Part P\u2019 guidelines, so you don\u2019t have to notify your local building control body if you want to:\r\n\r\nReplace light bulbs or plug fuses\r\nReplace a simple light fitting\r\nReplace an existing socket or light switch like for like\r\nMake repairs to loose wirings in switches, light fittings, or plugs\r\nReplace a hard-wired smoke detector\r\nFit a replacement door bell\r\nReplace dimmer modules\r\nReplace light switches\r\nReplace sockets\r\nReplace spotlight transformers\r\nConnect or disconnect appliances\r\nRe-position sockets (as long as it doesn\u2019t involve a running new circuit or wiring)\r\nInstall new or replacement extractor fans (like for like)\r\nReplace like-for-like electric radiators\r\nReplace like-for-like towel radiators\r\nSo as you can see, even if you\u2019re not a fully qualified electrician there are still plenty of jobs around the house you can do yourself. However, if you don\u2019t feel confident about doing any of those little fixes around your home (and we do understand that people are naturally wary of working with electrical fittings), then don\u2019t hesitate to call in a professional.",

        "title": "5 things to remember when hiring an electrician",
        "body": "Electrical work is tricky and dangerous to figure out on your own. The slightest error can lead to a short circuit or fire, so it\u2019s a good idea to hire an electrician, even if it\u2019s for the smallest of jobs:\r\n1. Ask to see proof of their qualification\r\n2. Check for a governing body.\r\nMake sure they are registered with a governing body like NAPIT or NICEIC. You can do this by simply going onto the relevant websites and entering their name to see if they are listed there. You can also check on Registered Competent Person Electrical.\r\n\r\n3. Read previous, relevant reviews\r\n\r\nRead through their MyBuilder reviews. Being positively reviewed is not enough in and of itself\u2014you need to check if they are relevant to the job you need done. Read through previous reviews to confirm that your potential electrician has been well-reviewed for jobs similar to yours. Check also for reliability and punctuality. Customers often leave detailed comments and feedback\u2014make use of these!\r\n\r\n4. Agree to a quote\r\n\r\nBefore you hire, make sure you are agreeing to a quote and not a rough estimate. The quote should include details about the job, concrete prices, and a payment schedule that outlines a deposit as well as a payment calendar. The schedule is particularly important, since it is what avoids misunderstandings down the line.\r\n\r\n5. Don\u2019t pick the cheapest option\r\n\r\nWhen considering different quotes from your shortlisted electricians, don\u2019t pick the cheapest one. Read through the quote carefully to ensure that you end up picking the best person for your job. Anything that sounds too good to be true usually is.\r\n\r\nFinally, once your job has been completed, get a certificate issued for it. If your electrician doesn\u2019t agree to this, that\u2019s a major red flag and you should reconsider hiring them.",

        "title": "Choosing the right bathroom fitter",
        "body": "Bathrooms are one of the most functional rooms in our homes, in use everyday and forced to deal with a lot of wear and tear.\r\nWhether you\u2019re updating a tired family bathroom or looking to install a luxury en suite, with such an important space, it\u2019s vital that you find the right bathroom fitter to perform the work. We spoke to some of the experienced tradesmen recommended on MyBuilder to find out the key things you should know in order to make the right choice:\r\n\r\nLook out for experience as much as accreditations\r\nMake sure you are comfortable with them\r\nGet quotes that cover everything\r\nEstablish a payment plan\r\nCheck their familiarity with building regulations\r\nEnsure there are follow-ups after the build\r\nKeeping these points in mind can help you focus on what to look for when you\u2019re meeting with tradesmen and getting quotes for the work. Carry on reading for more details on how to go about finding the right tradesman for your job.\r\n\r\nLook out for experience as much as accreditations\r\n\r\nBathrooms are far from a simple, off-the-peg purchase. Although the basics of bathroom fitting may appear outwardly similar from job to job - installing a bath, a sink, a toilet, perhaps some tiling - the devil is in the detail, and there are big differences between swapping in a new three-piece suite, and renovating a large bathroom with extras such as floor-to-ceiling tiling and underfloor heating.\r\n\r\nAs with many jobs, there are a range of available tradesmen who will be able to take on the project. At one end of the scale, there are firms that specialise in bathroom fitting, working with you on every element of the build, from designing the new bathroom to installation and decoration. At the other end of the scale will be more general builders and plumbers, who have the necessary skills to remove and fit a bathroom, but may outsource jobs like installing electric showers. Both have their advantages - while a specialised firm will likely deliver a very high standard to your exact specifications, the chances are it will be more expensive than hiring a generalist.\r\n\r\nWhen looking for a tradesman for your project, it\u2019s sensible to speak to ones who have performed similar jobs to the one you have planned. As well as seeing previous examples of their work that they can show you as part of their portfolio, you may also be able to arrange through them to visit their previous jobs - they should be happy to put you in touch with previous clients they have done work for before.\r\n\r\nAs well as checking their references, there are other things you can do to check their experience. On MyBuilder, you can read honest feedback on the jobs they have undertaken for homeowners, as well as seeing pictures of the jobs they have taken on. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask them questions as well, about any qualifications they may have, their length of time working with bathroom installation, or how they\u2019ll approach your own particular job.\r\n\r\nGet your job started today\r\n\r\nPost your job now to get quick responses from local tradesmen across the UK.\r\nPost a job\r\nSome tradesmen may belong to trade associations. As well as general trade bodies for builders like the Federation of Master Builders and the Guild of Master Craftsmen, bathroom fitters may also be part of the Kitchen, Bathroom and Bedroom Association (KBSA), which offers protection for consumers who hire KBSA members.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is experience that is the most important thing to look out for. Charles Bell of Charles Bell Refurbishments, who has more than 150 pieces of positive feedback on MyBuilder, said:\r\n\r\nExperience is really what\u2019s key when it comes to bathroom fitting, as there are so many parts of the job someone has to learn to become good at it. It took me years to really get going with it. I learnt on the job - there\u2019s the tiling, there\u2019s the plumbing, all these different elements. You also learn the importance of knowing about and purchasing the right materials.\r\n\r\nCharles Bell, Charles Bell Refurbishments\r\nMake sure you are comfortable with them\r\n\r\nAs well as knowing if they are experienced with your kind of job, you should simply assess how comfortable you feel with the potential tradesmen. You can do that from your first contact with them; are they polite on the phone, do they arrive for meetings at the scheduled time, do they ask lots of questions about the project?\r\n\r\nBathroom fittings aren\u2019t completed in a couple of hours - depending on the size of the job, it can last for as little as a few days, or up to several weeks. Much of that time, if your bathroom is out of action, you may need to vacate your home while your tradesman works on it. Being able to maintain good communication throughout the project is essential. You shouldn\u2019t try to become best friends with them, but you should be able to have a professional relationship - you must feel comfortable speaking openly about any concerns that may arise, and dealing with any issues. James Woodham of Akiva Projects said:\r\n\r\nI believe that every tradesman that comes into your house should be really friendly, really experienced, really clean and tidy. And they should be able to explain everything to the client. Every time we leave a project I like to think we leave them with knowledge as well. You can never provide a client with too much information. The more you ask them, the more they feel involved in the process, and the more confident they can feel in you.",
